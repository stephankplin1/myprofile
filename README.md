# **My Experience in The Year Up Program**
## Bio
My name is stephan kplin and i am soon to be a graduate of the yearup program project management course. I have a lot of intrest most of them are in the tech world and some are art based. I am really into tattoo art, espeically dark thin nihlistic style art. I also enjoy a little bit of gaming, not nearly as much as i di in my youth but i stil enjoy picking up the controller very once in a while. I just commited myself to a fitnes journey so that is taking up most of my time at the moment!

## A cool picture!
The picture below might not really describe me but this is the type of tattoos i was talking about when i said dark and thin lined. I actually want my friend to get this because he wants to go for a dark nautical theme for his tattoos.
